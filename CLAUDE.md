# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with this repository.

## Project Overview

DG-Agent is a browser-based AI controller for DG-Lab Coyote (2.0 & 3.0) pulse devices. Users chat with an AI in natural language, and the AI controls the device via Web Bluetooth. The app is a React 18 SPA built with Vite and deployed to GitHub Pages.

The codebase is a **monorepo** using npm workspaces with a contract/adapter architecture.

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — Start local dev server (Vite, apps/web)
- `npm run build` — Build all workspaces (type-check + vite build)
- `npm run typecheck` — Type-check all workspaces
- `npm run test` — Run vitest across all workspaces (every package uses `vitest run`; no separate self-test entry points)
- `npm run lint` — ESLint with zero warnings allowed
- `npm run lint:fix` — Auto-fix lint issues
- `npm run format` — Format with Prettier
- `npm run format:check` — Check formatting

## Architecture

### Monorepo Structure

```
apps/web/          — React 18 SPA (pure UI shell: components, hooks, browser-only services)
packages/
  core/                  — Shared types AND contract interfaces
                           (DeviceState, SessionSnapshot, DeviceClient, LlmClient, ...)
  runtime/               — Agent loop, policy engine, tool executor, turn state, prompt presets
  client/                — AgentClient abstraction (embedded / HTTP) + REST route definitions
  agent-browser/         — Browser-side agent composition layer (no React deps);
                           exports createBrowserServices() factory
  device-webbluetooth/   — Web Bluetooth adapter for Coyote v2/v3
  providers-openai-http/ — OpenAI-compatible HTTP/SSE transport
  providers-catalog/     — Provider registry (free proxy, Qwen, DeepSeek, etc.)
  bridge/                — Bridge manager, message queue, permission service,
                           QQ (OneBot/NapCat) and Telegram adapters
  permissions-browser/   — Browser permission service (timed grants + UI prompt)
  waveforms/             — Built-in waveform definitions and browser waveform
                           library (IndexedDB store, import/export)
  storage-browser/       — IndexedDB session store + localStorage settings
  audio-browser/         — DashScope ASR/TTS, browser SpeechRecognition/Synthesis
aliyun-fc/               — Aliyun FC serverless free proxy (CommonJS, separate)
```

### Core Data Flow

```
apps/web (React UI)
  → @dg-agent/agent-browser (createBrowserServices factory)
    → AgentClient (embedded) → Runtime
      → DeviceClient / LlmClient / PermissionService
```

The runtime's `runTurn()` loops: build instructions → call LLM → if tool calls, execute them (with permission gate + per-turn caps) → loop until text-only reply.

### Key Patterns

- **UI / Agent separation**: `apps/web` is a pure React shell. All browser-side
  agent composition (LLM client, device, bridge, speech, permissions, etc.)
  lives in `@dg-agent/agent-browser`'s `createBrowserServices()` factory,
  which is plain TS with no React dependency. `apps/web` only adds React
  lifecycle wrapping (useMemo) and UI-only services (theme, safety guard,
  update checker in `apps/web/src/services/`).
- **Contract/Adapter**: `@dg-agent/core` defines interfaces, concrete
  implementations live in adapter packages (`device-webbluetooth`,
  `providers-openai-http`, `permissions`, `waveforms`, etc.). For future
  Node.js builds, add new adapters (`device-*-node`, `storage-node`,
  `bridge-node`) and an `agent-node` composition package alongside the
  existing browser-side ones — `core`/`runtime`/`client` are reusable as-is.
- **Per-channel burst quota**: Burst calls are tracked per channel (A/B), not globally.
- **Policy engine**: Hard-coded safety caps the LLM cannot bypass (max iterations, strength limits, cold-start clamp).
- **Model context strategy**: `last-user-turn` / `last-five-user-turns` / `full-history`.

## Development Conventions

- Branch model: develop on `dev` or feature branches, PRs to `dev`. `main` is for releases only.
- UI strings and error messages are in Chinese (Simplified).
- The `aliyun-fc/` directory is a standalone CommonJS serverless function — not part of the TypeScript monorepo.
- All packages use `"type": "module"` with the `Bundler` module resolution mode.
- Use `import type` for type-only imports.
- Unused vars must use `_` prefix pattern.

### Package naming convention

Mixed by design — read the rule before adding a new package:

- **No suffix** (`waveforms`, `bridge`): contains a runtime-agnostic core
  (Node-friendly) alongside a browser adapter, both in the same package.
  Top-level module load must stay free of DOM / IndexedDB references so
  Node consumers can import the package without exploding.
- **`-browser` / `-webbluetooth` suffix** (`agent-browser`, `audio-browser`,
  `device-webbluetooth`, `permissions-browser`, `storage-browser`): pure
  browser-runtime implementation; no counterpart in the same package.
  Future Node.js alternatives ship as separate packages (`storage-node`,
  `permissions-node`, `device-serial`, `agent-node`, etc.) rather than
  being merged in.
- **`-http` / `-catalog` suffix** (`providers-openai-http`,
  `providers-catalog`): describes a transport or role rather than a
  runtime; reusable across runtimes.

When adding a new package, pick the suffix style that matches its
category above. Do not introduce a third style.

## UI Maintenance Notes

These behaviors have been confirmed by the user — do not change without explicit request.

### Layout

- Sidebar spacing (expand/collapse button, new session, session entries, settings) — do not tweak
- Send button must stay below the input box, not inline right
- Input area is a floating layer at the bottom, not a normal block
- Empty session shows only "欢迎使用 DG-Agent ！" — no example prompts

### ChatPanel

- Title bar must always be visible (not scrollable)
- Device status bar sits below the title bar, fully hidden when disconnected
- Input area is floating; must not drift upward when few messages

### Settings

- Settings save on drawer close, not on input blur or debounce
- Model context strategy, bridge config, voice config all follow the same rule

### Device & Bluetooth

- Bluetooth chooser only appears on explicit user click — never auto-triggered by messages or AI tool calls
- Session switch does not disconnect the device
- New/switch session clears permission grant cache

### Toasts

- Don't duplicate errors already shown in chat bubbles
- Timer-related system messages go in chat area, not toast
- No small colored pills above the input box

### Bridge

- Bridge messages route to the active session, auto-creating one if needed
- Bridge source persisted in session metadata for reply routing
- QQ/NapCat token passed via WebSocket URL query param `access_token`
